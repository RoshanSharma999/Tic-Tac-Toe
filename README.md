I developed this game using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks used. 
Initially, the game featured only a 1-player mode to play against the computer(no intelligence, random moves). Later, I enhanced it by adding a 2-player mode. 
It was an enjoyable experience to build this project.
